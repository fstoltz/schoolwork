Possible improvements:

- Maybe I can implement a recursive algorithm somewhere ----> NOT DONE

- Check thorougly that the code follow good OOP principles ----> Sort of, I think there's still a few places where it's not proper OOP Design.

- Implement "default-school" functionality, so that the "sc1" calls are not hardcoded like they are at the moment of writing. ----> NOT DONE
